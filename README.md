# MST
>A program to compute MST of a graph
## Background:
This program is designed to use Tarjan and Cheriton's round-robin algorithm to compute a minimun spannning tree of a given undirected graph with positive edge weights. 
This is my favorite projecct I have completed to date.
## Resources:
The input graphs are stored in two plain text documents: graph1.txt and graph2.txt

The input files are organized such that the first line has some integer N which corresponds to the number of vertices. The next N lines are the names of the vertices.
All of the remaining lines represent edges. The edges are formatted so that the letters represent vertices and the integers are the edge weight of that specific edge.
